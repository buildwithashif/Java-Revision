# Java Revision - 0 to Placement Journey

This repository contains my Java practice and revision programs as part of my "0 to Placement Journey".  
Files are organized by day:

- *Day1* – Basics & Simple Programs  
- *Day2* – Loops & Conditions  
- *Day3* – Arrays & Functions  
- *Day4* – Nested Loops & Patterns  

## Notes
- All code is in Java  
- Unnecessary files are ignored via .gitignore
- Each day has easy, medium, and hard problems
